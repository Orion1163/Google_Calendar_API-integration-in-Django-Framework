# Google_Calendar_API-integration-in-Django-Framework

Welcome to my Django project where I explore the integration of Google Calendar into a web application! If you've ever wanted to seamlessly incorporate calendar functionality into your Django project, you're in the right place. This project guides you through every step, from setting up OAuth2 authentication to displaying Google Calendar events on your website.

**Features:**

1. OAuth2 Authentication Setup: Learn how to set up OAuth2 authentication with Google Cloud Console. This allows your Django application to securely access users' Google Calendar data.

2. Google Calendar API Integration: Dive into the world of Google Calendar API using the google-api-python-client library. Fetch calendar events directly from users' primary calendars and integrate them into your application.

3. Token Management: Understand the process of generating OAuth2 tokens and storing them securely. This ensures your application can access Google Calendar data while respecting user privacy and security.

4. Database Integration: Store fetched calendar events in your Django application's database for easy retrieval and display. This provides a seamless user experience and enables further customization.

5. Error Handling and Best Practices: Implement error handling, pagination, and caching to improve the reliability and performance of your application. Follow best practices to ensure a smooth user experience.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Set Up Google Cloud Console:**
   - Create a new project on Google Cloud Console.
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" and create OAuth 2.0 client ID.
   - Configure the consent screen with necessary details and add redirect URIs.
   - Download the client secret JSON file (`credentials.json`).

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Use pip to install the necessary libraries:
     ```
     pip install google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client
     ```

3. **Configure Django Settings:**
   - Add OAuth2 credentials obtained from Google Cloud Console to your Django project's `settings.py`.
   - Set `GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET`.

4. **Implement OAuth2 Authentication View:**
   - Create a view to initiate OAuth2 flow and redirect users to Google's OAuth consent screen.
   - Use `google_auth_oauthlib.flow.Flow` to create the OAuth2 flow instance.
   - Redirect users to the `authorization_url` obtained from the flow.

5. **Handle OAuth2 Callback:**
   - Create another view to handle the OAuth2 callback from Google.
   - Exchange the authorization code for access and refresh tokens using `flow.fetch_token()`.
   - Store tokens securely (e.g., in session or database).

6. **Generate Tokens:**
   - Create a script (`generate_token.py`) to initiate OAuth2 flow and generate tokens.
   - Use `google_auth_oauthlib.flow.InstalledAppFlow` to create the flow instance.
   - Run the flow locally and store tokens securely (e.g., in a file named `token.json`).

7. **Integrate Google Calendar API:**
   - Use the `google-api-python-client` library to interact with Google Calendar API.
   - Follow the Google Calendar API documentation to fetch and process calendar events.

8. **Display Events on Your Website:**
   - Once you have fetched events from Google Calendar, integrate them into your Django templates to display to users.

Follow these steps carefully to seamlessly integrate Google Calendar into your Django project and enhance your event management capabilities.
